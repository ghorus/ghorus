## Hi I'm Victor, a software engineer and web developer! 
I guess you can say I'm a **digital craftsman**

Progressively evolving the efficiency of impactful ideas. Energetically visualizing strategic initiatives for resolving real world challenges.

**Game Programmer & Designer - "Only Downhill from Here"**

- Designed and developed all the animations for 9 characters, the 3 levels that each have a boss, the storyline, and the dialogues using Python's Pygame library.
- Identified challenges with gameplay mechanics, compatibility of certain music, and created algorithms for enemy attacks using object oriented coding. 
**Push up/sit ups progress tracker with mobile application and local database - "The Best of Me"**

- Ideated a method for users to stay persistent with their workout by tracking total push ups and sit ups done over a lifetime. 
**Web Design for an STD Hackathon Case Study **
-Collaborated with software programmers and health practitioners to create compelling ways of resolving the rise of sexually transmitted diseases by building web designs.
