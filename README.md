## Hi I'm Victor, a self-taught software engineer and web developer! 
I guess you can say I'm a **digital craftsman**

My coding journey as of this moment, I've probably watched close to thousands of YouTube tutorials teaching myself as much as I can to land a coding job! My aim is to become comfortable enough 
to create anything I want and understand the software world as much as I can.
